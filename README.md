## About the Applied Data Science Lab
The **Applied Data Science Lab** at WorldQuant University equips students with practical data science skills through project-based learning. The curriculum emphasizes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning and predictive modeling
- Data visualization and dashboard creation
- Statistical analysis and experimentation

The projects in this repository demonstrate my ability to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to data pipeline development.
